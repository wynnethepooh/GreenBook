   * Example:
   *          1
   *        /  \
   *       /    \
   *      2      3

   *   9    6  4  5
   *    \  /  / \
   *   10 11 12 7
   *
   * The first diagonal includes 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
   * The second diagonal includes 2 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 19
   * The third diagonal includes 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 42
   * The output should be [9, 19, 42]
